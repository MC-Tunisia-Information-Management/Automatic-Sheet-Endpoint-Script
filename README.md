# Automatic-Sheet-Endpoint-Script
The "form-to-google-sheets" script automates the process of recording form submissions into a Google Sheet. Initially, it sets up the script by storing the active spreadsheet's ID in the script properties. When a form is submitted, the `doPost` function locks the script to prevent concurrent executions, retrieves the sheet specified by `sheetName`, and maps the form responses to the sheet's headers. It adds a new row with the form data, including a timestamp if the header is "Date". The script then writes this data to the sheet and returns a JSON response indicating success or error, ensuring data integrity and logging for debugging.
